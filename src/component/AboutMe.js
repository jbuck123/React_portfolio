           <p>
               Hello! I am new to web development and coding in general. I was a carpenter with a passion for tech, building computers and videogames.
               currently I am trying to switch my hobby into my career and my former career as a carpenter into a hobby! I am a graduate from a coding bootcamp hosted by the 
               University of Minnesota. I am working hard to develop new skills in React, Javascript, css, html and incorporate other awesome frameworks!
