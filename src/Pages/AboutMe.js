          Hello! I am new to web development and coding in general. I was a
          carpenter with a passion for tech dating back to early childhood.
          currently I am trying to switch my hobby into my career and my former
          career as a carpenter into a hobby! I am a graduate from a coding
          bootcamp hosted by the University of Minnesota. I am working hard to
          develop new skills in React, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
